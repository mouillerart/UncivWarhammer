Held on the first week of Plough-Tide, the village sits on the edge of a large, boggy lake that provides the populace with their fresh water. A few days after the Spring Equinox, the lake “turns”—the cooler water at the bottom swaps with the warmer water on top. This churns up a tremendous amount of algae and scum from the bottom, giving the top of the lake a sickly green colour and horrible smell. To celebrate the coming of spring, the townsfolk bathe in the lake and fill large barrels full of the scum-filled waters. This water is scattered over the newly planted crops and tossed onto barns and houses by the local Priest of Taal. The lake is said to have curative powers and the sick, lame, and elderly travel from miles around to have the priest anoint them with this Blessed Water. Those travelling into town can tell that the festival is underway by the pungent odour in the air, which can be smelled from miles away."}

Whether they are honouring his protector aspect, or his deceiver aspect, or some other facet of the inscrutable deity, is down to each individual. The service is led by cloaked and masked priests of Ranald. After the service, each beggar donates what he can before the congregation feasts upon whatever the cult has managed to provide. Some of the wealthiest personages of Altdorf find their larder a little empty that night. Undoubtedly, the conversation over the feast is always about what new things can be stolen, who are the easiest marks, and what are the newest ways to part the rich and the naive from their money. The Brotherhood of Altdorf does not approve of the Beggar's Banquet and refuses to support it. It is too unrefined and indiscriminate for their tastes.

The Halflings themselves do not ascribe any particular reverence to the occasion, something that has not been overlooked by those Humans who believe Halflings to be nothing but worthless, gluttonous layabouts. Human towns have begun including pie eating contests, awards for the best or most unusual pies, and other festivities. Business, other than that dedicated to the making of pies or the selling of alcohol to wash it down, often grinds to a halt during Pie Week."}

Even if this is in question they are certainly one of the most, if not the most, ancient Knightly Order, tracing their existence back to the wars against Araby nearly a thousand years ago. Knights from all over the Old World joined in the war against the Sultans of Araby, driving their armies from the south of Estalia and carrying the battle to Araby itself. The returning Knights brought back much plunder from the Sultans' Palaces, including gold and silver, precious gems, silks, furs, and many exotic animals the like of which had never been seen before in the Old World. Some of the most amazing and beautiful creatures were the panthers, liberated from the pleasure gardens of Istrabul. They created such an abiding impression to the jubilant crowds cheering the return of the crusaders, in seeing some of the Knights parading them attached to gold chains, that the Order of the Knights Panther was founded. In time the creatures died but their fur would be used for saddle cloths or trimming for fur cloaks, reinforcing the new Order's unique character and reminding everyone of their victories in Araby. Today the original panthers and even their hides have long gone, but the memory of the Arabyan wars is maintained in every Panther's raiment by wearing the hide of any spotted creature they can find and the panther emblem emblazoned on their shields."},
			{"text": "Although the crusades are distant memory the Knights Panther today stand for the preservation of racial purity in The Empire and are dedicated to the annihilation of all mutants and any kind of Chaos taint. They have a substantial presence in the staunchly Ulrican cities of Middenheim and Talabheim and can be seen on many public occasions. There exists a friendly rivalry with the Knights of the White Wolf (another pro-Ulric Order of Knights). The Knights Panther consider their battle tactics rather crude while at the same time the Knights of the White Wolf consider the Panthers to be too interested in keeping their armoured suits highly polished than indulging in serious martial training."}

It is important that the Ranger-Templars undergo these periodic raids into the Taiga to stem the tide of Chaos incursions into the sparsely populated Translynsk and to prevent warbands from penetrating into Kislev itself. Aside from hunting Beastmen in the forests, the Brotherhood of the Bear also strives to protect places sacred to Taal.
